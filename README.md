## Welcome to GargenG
[![Deploy to DO](https://mp-assets1.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/deploy-to-do/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/victorvhs/GardenG/tree/main)
This is an application that will help you grow plants.
There is nothing better than reconnecting with the earth and watching a small (sometimes not very small) plant life grow.
* We are going to use the hottest technologies at the moment.
* React.js for the frontend
* Bulma.css
* Chakra-ui
* The power of Next.js to generate the site as quickly as possible.
* The source of all plant information will be https://trefle.io/

All of this will be running on the DigitalOcean cloud.

This app is for a DigitalOcean's Hackathon.

You can read about the app on my https://dev.to articles.
